# Fix Plan for 20250510-initial-test

Based on the `task_list.md` and `root_cause.md`, the following steps will be taken to address the errors:

- [ ] **Initialize `params.input` in `main.nf`**:
    - Modify `main.nf` to provide a valid default for `params.input`.
    - For initial testing, use a relevant nf-core test samplesheet, for example:
      `params.input = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nf-core/test-datasets/modules/data/delete_me/microbiome/illumina_PE_ERR123456_subset.csv'` (or a similar test samplesheet suitable for bagobugs/funcscan if this one is not appropriate).

- [ ] **Handle Profile Information Correctly in `main.nf`**:
    - For the `log.info` block in `main.nf`, change `params.profile ?: 'none'` to `workflow.profile ?: 'none'` to correctly display active profile(s).
    - Ensure `scripts/run_nf.sh` is correctly passing the `-profile` argument to sub-pipeline `nextflow run` commands. If so, direct usage of `params.profile` within `main.nf` process script blocks might be unnecessary and can be reviewed/removed to avoid conflicts.

- [ ] **Review and Refine `main.nf` Structure (as per Option A from task_list.md for now)**:
    - Given `scripts/run_nf.sh` is intended to handle sequential execution of nf-core pipelines, simplify `main.nf`.
    - The goal is to make `main.nf` a very basic Nextflow script, primarily for `nextflow info .` or as a placeholder if it evolves into a true meta-pipeline later.
    - This might involve removing or commenting out complex workflow/process blocks in `main.nf` that might conflict with `scripts/run_nf.sh`'s role.

- [ ] **Re-run the pipeline**:
    - After applying fixes, re-run with `make run slug=fix-initial-params args="-profile docker -resume"` (using a new slug).
