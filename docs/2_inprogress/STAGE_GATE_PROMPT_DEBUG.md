**Context**  
An error log was saved inside `_debug/<YYYYMMDD-slug>/error_log.txt`  
and referenced with `@` in this chat.

---

## Instructions

1. **Read the Error Log**  
   - Open the referenced `@error_log.txt`.  
   - Summarise the root cause in *max three* bullet points.

2. **Write `root_cause.md`**  
   Include:  
   - **Root Cause** ‚Äì concise description.  
   - **Evidence** ‚Äì log snippets or file paths that prove it.

3. **Create `fix_plan.md`**  
   - A markdown checklist of concrete steps to resolve the issue.  
   - Typical items:  
     - `[ ]` Download / move missing database files.  
     - `[ ]` Update `nextflow.config ‚Ä∫ params.*` path(s).  
     - `[ ]` Re-run the pipeline with `-resume`.  
   - Put the file next to `root_cause.md` inside the same `_debug/‚Ä¶` folder.

4. **Append New Tasks to Main `task_list.md`**  
   - Add a new subsection **‚Äúüî¥ Bug-fixes‚Äù** (create if absent).  
   - Copy the checklist items from `fix_plan.md` under that section.

5. **Version-Control**  
   Run the helper script to snapshot this debug session:  
   ```bash
   ./scripts/vc.sh "fix: record $(basename $(dirname $PWD))/db-error & create fix plan"

6. **Output to Chat**
   - Show the contents of root_cause.md.
   - Show the contents of fix_plan.md.
   - Confirm that tasks were appended and commit was pushed.

7. **Stop**
   - Wait for the user to approve or edit fix_plan.md before executing any steps.

**Notes for Cursor**
   - Use the existing helper script scripts/vc.sh for Git add/commit/push.
   - Do not execute the fix steps yet‚Äîonly create and commit the plan.
   - All paths are relative to the feature‚Äôs root folder.
   - The error log is always at `docs/2_inprogress/shotgun-metagenomics-pipeline/_debug/*/error_log.txt` so you can auto-detect the latest folder if the user doesn‚Äôt @-reference it.
